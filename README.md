## 🔥 Overview

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have become increasingly versatile, accompanied by impressive Optical Character Recognition (OCR) related capabilities. 
Existing OCR-related benchmarks emphasize evaluating LMMs' abilities of relatively simple visual question answering, visual-text parsing, etc. However, the extent to which LMMs can deal with complex logical reasoning problems based on OCR cues is relatively unexplored.  
To this end, we introduce the **Reasoning-OCR** benchmark, which challenges LMMs to solve complex reasoning problems based on the cues that can be extracted from rich visual-text. 
**Reasoning-OCR** covers six visual scenarios and encompasses 150 meticulously designed questions categorized into six reasoning challenges. Additionally, Reasoning-OCR minimizes the impact of field-specialized knowledge. 
Our evaluation offers some insights for proprietary and open-source LMMs in different reasoning challenges, underscoring the urgent to improve the reasoning performance.
We hope Reasoning-OCR can inspire and facilitate future research on enhancing complex reasoning ability based on OCR cues.



## 📌 Key Findings

- **LMMs desire enhancement on complex reasoning using OCR cues.**

- **Text-centric LMMs lag far behind advanced generic LMMs on reasoning ability.**

- **LMMs fall short in decision reasoning.**

- **CoT generally helps LMMs achieve better reasoning performance.**

- **Providing the answer hint can improve the accuracy.**

- **Designing task-specific instruction may be helpful.**

## 🔨 Evaluation

```python
### First, download the code and dataset
git clone https://github.com/Hxyz-123/ReasoningOCR
cd ReasoningOCR
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/loptr/ReasoningOCR/resolve/main/img.zip
unzip img.zip
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/loptr/ReasoningOCR/resolve/main/qa.json
    
### Second, eval the vlms. You can use example/qwen2_vl.py as a guide to run inference on your target VLM.
python example/qwen2_vl.py --model_path path_to_model --device 0 --img_path ./img --json_path ./qa.json --out_path ./org_results/qwen2vl-7b

### Third, use regular expressions or GPT-4o to extract the answer.
python eval/ans_extr.py --org_path ./org_results/qwen2vl-7b --json_path ./qa.json --out_path ./ext_results/qwen2vl-7b

### Finally, evaluate the answer accuracy.
python eval/eval.py --ans_path ./ext_results/qwen2vl-7b --json_path ./qa.json
```
